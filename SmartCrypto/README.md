SmartView2 Handshake API implementation in pure python3 with example of how to use handshake to send commands

Samsung Smart TV H/J (2014/2015) models SmartView2 Crypto Handshake C/Python implementation.

The responsibility for the damage caused by the use of that code is on the user him/herself. In particular, Samsung has nothing to do with the code and does not guarantee anything.

How to use:

go into smartcrypto.py and edit the ip address on line 15 to your tvs address 
run smartcrypto.py

After pairing it will print a ctx and session id

On the last line of smartcrypto.py you can see the method send_command

If you save the ctx and sessionid from the previous pairing session you can write code to call send_command again without needing to repair. just use the ctx and session id from before.
